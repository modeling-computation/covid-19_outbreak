#### Abstract

Background: The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has necessitated the development of predictive models to help healthcare providers prepare and respond to outbreaks more quickly and effectively, ultimately leading to better patient care. This study aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) method to detect early COVID-19 outbreaks or identify potential early outbreaks by analyzing epidemiological data in the Republic of Korea.
Objective: Our primary objective was to develop an ML-based method to predict the transmission trend of COVID-19 and propose a new approach for detecting the start time of new outbreaks, enabling timely response and efficient allocation of resources.

Methods: We utilized various ML techniques to predict COVID-19 transmission trends and designed a new method to detect the start time of new outbreaks. To measure the change in the transmission trend, we constructed a risk index and label. The study employed ML techniques to detect the start time of new outbreaks based on Label 2, which was maintained for at least 14 days, and predicted labels to detect future transmission trends early. We compared the performance of different ML models to identify the most accurate approach for outbreak detection.

Results: Our ML methods demonstrated high accuracy (over 90%) in estimating the classification of the transmission trend (Increase, Maintain, or Decrease). The proposed method accurately predicted the start time of new major outbreaks and provided a standard for predicting the start time of minor outbreaks. Among the ML models, the Random Forest classifier exhibited the highest accuracy in outbreak detection.


Conclusions: The developed ML-based method offers an explainable standard for accurately predicting the start time of both major and minor outbreaks, enabling healthcare providers to respond more effectively to COVID-19 transmission. This method can contribute to the development of targeted prevention and control measures, facilitating better management of resources during the pandemic. By employing this approach, authorities can take timely action to mitigate the spread of the virus, ultimately improving patient care and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.
